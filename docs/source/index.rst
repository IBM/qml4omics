QBioCode
#######################################

QBioCode is an open-source suite of computational resources dedicated to exploring and developing quantum applications tailored for healthcare and life science (HCLS) data.
Our goal is to levearege unique capabilites of quantum compunting to tacke some of the most complex challanges in HCLS.
Within this toolkit are analytic methods that span ... for omics scale data.

QBioCode is easy to use and simplifies the development of new software tools. 
QBioCode provides access to individual tools as well as detailed use cases for analyses that demonstrate how multiple methodologies can be leveraged together.
